# JavadocMark

In the era of AI-powered code editors like Cursor, developers often face challenges when working with newer Java dependencies. Traditional Javadoc documentation, while comprehensive, isn't always directly accessible to AI models. This limitation can lead to generated code that doesn't fully align with the latest API interfaces.

**JavadocMark** was created to bridge this gap. It generates Javadoc documentation in Markdown format, which can be directly included in your project. This approach enables AI models to read and understand the documentation more effectively, significantly improving the accuracy of generated code that uses modern Java libraries.

**JavadocMark** is a custom Java Doclet that generates Javadoc documentation in Markdown format, ready to use on GitHub. You can check the documentation generated by **JavadocMark** in the following project:

* [JavadocMark itself!](https://github.com/xiaowangzhixiao/javadocmark/tree/master/javadoc/com/manxiaozhi/javadocmark)

## Main Features

1. Generate package-level documentation (README.md), including:
   - Package name and description
   - Type table (classes, interfaces, enums) with names, types, and descriptions
   - Support for inner classes, with file names and titles including outer class names

2. Generate type-level documentation (TypeName.md), including:
   - Type name and full description
   - Field list and descriptions
   - Method list with parameters, return values, and exception descriptions
   - Support for inner classes, with file names and titles including outer class names

## Usage

Add the following configuration to your Maven project's `POM` file:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-javadoc-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.9</version>
    <configuration>
        <doclet>com.manxiaozhi.javadocmark.JavadocMark</doclet>
        <docletArtifact>
            <groupId>com.manxiaozhi</groupId>
            <artifactId>javadocmark</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0</version>
        </docletArtifact>
        <reportOutputDirectory>./</reportOutputDirectory>
        <destDir>./</destDir>
        <additionalparam>-d javadoc/</additionalparam>
        <useStandardDocletOptions>false</useStandardDocletOptions>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

This will generate documentation in the `javadoc/` subdirectory of your project.

## Java8 doclint Issues

If you're using Java8, you might encounter doclint validation issues, especially when using markdown blockquote syntax. To resolve this, simply add the following configuration to your `pom.xml` file to disable doclint:

```xml
<properties>
    <additionalparam>-Xdoclint:none</additionalparam>
</properties>
```

## Developing JavadocMark

JavadocMark requires Apache Maven. To build the project, run:

```
$ ./mvnw install
```

To generate Markdown documentation for JavadocMark itself, run:

```
$ ./mvnw -P javadocmark-generation javadoc:javadoc
```
